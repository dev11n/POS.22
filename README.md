# POS.22
## What is POS.22?
POS.22 (**P**roject **O**ld **S**tar **S**table **O**nline 20**22**) was a project I started a few months ago as of writing this, aimed at launching the old Star Stable Online versions (pre-2020) and at least being able to fly around in it so the old players could get some nostalgia kicks from it.
## Is it still being worked on?
To an extent, it's varying. I'll work on it whenever I got the time and feel motivated enough.
## Can I contribute on the project?
Yeah, I left Pull Requests open just for that. Do note that you **have** to follow the `LICENSE` attached in the repository, and that you are modifying the game **on your own behalf, I am not responsible for anything you do.**
## How do I use it?
1. Build the project
2. Launch an old Star Stable Online version (you can ask others for a link inside the [Discord](https://discord.gg/47j28nJqnf)).
3. As soon as you see the loading screen, open `POS.22.exe` and wait for it to patch the memory
4. Done, read the console for keybindings.
